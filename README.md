## Privacy
- [Informal Laws](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/data-protection/sites/data-protection/files/using-twitter-research-v1.0.pdf)
- [Twitter Developer Terms of Agreement and Policy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy)

They basically say that a user's tweets are free to be used as long as the user is verified and the tweet isn't protected.

## How to Run
**Worked with Python v3.8.5.**

1. Install necessary dependencies.
    ```
    python -m venv twitter_env
    source twitter_env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. For your convenience, get the already-generated data from [box.com](https://ucla.box.com/s/w2bm8kmkvdcnu466iq99gxsq8oesdad3) and place it in the `api` directory.

    If you'd rather generate the data from scratch, write
    `GenerationThread().start()` at the bottom of `app.py` (in the project's root directory) and start the server with steps 3 and 4. Be warned that the generation task takes a while. The main bottleneck is generating polarity scores for each tweet with [Patricia's](https://github.com/PatriciaXiao/TIMME) model (more details in TODO), which takes a few days of leaving my laptop open and the process running. (More details on the generation and rehydration process in TODO.)

3. Add the necessary Twitter Developer API keys to a `.env` file in the project's root directory. Details are on [Twitter's](https://developer.twitter.com/en/support/twitter-api/developer-account) page. These are necessary for data rehydration (pinging the Twitter API to see which tweets are no longer public, for privacy reasons).

    Your `.env` file should look like:
    ```
    BEARER_TOKEN="<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN>"
    ```

    If you don't want to wait for your Twitter Developer account to be approved and aren't deploying the project with data rehydration enabled, you can replace `<YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN>` with garbage.

4. To start the server, stay in the project's root directory and run:
    ```
    flask run
    ```

5. In another terminal, install the frontend libraries.
    ```
    cd frontend
    yarn
    ```

6. Start the frontend.
    ```
    yarn start
    ```

## Documentation / Files and their Functionality
Note: The frontend was generated by [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) so there's some boilerplate code lying around.

Frontend docs generated by JSDoc and backend docs generated by Pydoc can be found by pointing browser to `<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_THIS_PROJECT>/docs/index.html`.

Frontend docs generated by running `yarn doc` in project's root directory. Backend docs generated by running `python3 -m pdoc --html --output-dir docs/back ./api/Server.py --force`.
